# Brazilian Ministry of Health Data Pipeline Modernization Project

## Executive Summary

As Technical Lead for this strategic modernization initiative, I led a small specialized team to transform the Brazilian Ministry of Health's data infrastructure from a legacy proprietary system to a modern, flexible, and significantly more efficient solution. We achieved a remarkable 95% reduction in data processing time (from 249 hours to 11 hours) while improving maintainability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

## Challenge Context

The Brazilian Ministry of Health maintained hundreds of critical data pipelines implemented in Informatica PowerCenter, facing several challenges:

- **Contract expiration**: The imminent end of the Informatica licensing agreement created urgency
- **Vendor lock-in**: Proprietary technology limited flexibility and increased long-term costs
- **Maintenance complexity**: Specialized knowledge requirements made ongoing support difficult
- **Performance limitations**: The existing system required approximately 11 days (249 hours) for complete data lake refreshes

## Solution Approach

Leading a cross-functional team of three developers (myself and two team members), I implemented a structured modernization approach:

1. **Technology evaluation**: Conducted comprehensive research on potential solutions, presenting both commercial and open-source alternatives to stakeholders
2. **Solution selection**: After thorough analysis, recommended and gained approval for Apache Airflow with Python as the optimal solution, balancing flexibility, community support, and cost-effectiveness
3. **Pipeline analysis**: Led detailed assessment of existing pipelines to document business rules, data transformations, dependencies, and edge cases
4. **Validation framework**: Developed an SQL-based validation methodology to verify our understanding of pipeline logic before implementation
5. **Architecture design**: Created a dynamic DAG Factory pattern enabling configuration-driven pipeline generation

## Technical Implementation

I architected and implemented a modern pipeline solution with these key components:

- **DAG Factory**: Developed a robust, extensible framework that generates Airflow DAGs dynamically from configuration files
- **Configuration-as-code**: Implemented a JSON-based pipeline definition system, enabling rapid onboarding of existing and new data flows
- **SQL standardization**: Refactored complex transformations into optimized SQL, improving maintainability and performance
- **Parallelization optimization**: Leveraged Airflow's advanced scheduling capabilities to maximize throughput efficiency
- **Technical documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for future maintainers

## Results and Business Impact

The project delivered exceptional outcomes for the Ministry of Health:

- **95% performance improvement**: Reduced data refresh time from 249 hours to just 11 hours
- **Operational flexibility**: Enabled weekend or overnight processing, significantly improving data availability
- **Elimination of licensing costs**: Transitioned from proprietary to open-source technology stack
- **Simplified maintenance**: Standardized approach reduced complexity and specialized knowledge requirements
- **Enhanced scalability**: Created a framework allowing easy addition of new data sources and pipelines

## Future Recommendations

Based on project learnings, I recommended:

- Implementing automated testing for critical pipelines
- Establishing a monitoring framework for data quality and performance metrics
- Conducting knowledge transfer sessions for broader team enablement
- Exploring cloud-based deployment options for further scalability improvements

This successful modernization has positioned the Ministry's data infrastructure for sustainable growth while delivering immediate operational benefits.
