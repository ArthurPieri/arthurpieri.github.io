# Access Control System Project: End-of-Project Summary

## Executive Summary

Our team successfully developed and launched a versatile Access Control System supporting both traditional NFC/RFID cards and smartphone-based access. Starting from an initial proof of concept, we expanded our offering to support multiple enterprise-grade brands, culminating in winning our first public tender. The team grew from 4 to 8 members while maintaining high cohesion and technical excellence.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

- **Backend**: Node.js-based server infrastructure providing scalable API services
- **Frontend**: Responsive Ember.js application with intuitive access management dashboards
- **Communication Layer**: Custom C/C++ protocols enabling multi-brand controller support
- **Firmware**: Optimized C/C++ controller firmware with robust security features

### Key Technical Achievements

- Successfully reverse-engineered and implemented compatibility with industry-standard access control systems
- Developed secure, low-latency communication between smartphone clients and physical access points
- Created extensible API architecture allowing rapid integration of new controller brands
- Designed and manufactured custom PCBs to optimize hardware performance and reliability

## Team Evolution

- **Initial Phase**: 4-person core team established product vision and MVP
    - 2 Developers (backend/firmware)
    - 1 UX Designer
    - 1 Project Manager (also serving as developer/tester)
- **Expansion Phase**: Strategic additions to support broader compatibility
    - 2 Additional Developers focused on protocol implementation
    - 1 UX/UI Designer specializing in mobile interfaces
    - 1 Electronics Engineer for hardware design and manufacturing

## Project Outcomes

- **Technical**: Successfully delivered compatibility with all target controller brands
- **Product**: Created a differentiated solution combining traditional and smartphone-based access
- **Business**: Won first significant public tender, validating market approach
- **Team**: 100% growth in technical capabilities while maintaining agile development practices

## Lessons Learned

- Early investment in a flexible API architecture paid dividends when expanding brand support
- Cross-functional collaboration between software and hardware teams was critical to success
- Maintaining focus on user experience while solving complex technical challenges kept the product commercially viable

## Next Steps

The foundation built through this project positions us for:

- Expanding enterprise integrations (HR systems, security platforms)
- Introducing advanced features like biometric authentication
- Scaling deployment and support capabilities for larger clients

This project has transformed us from a promising startup with a prototype into a competitive player in the access control market with a proven, differentiated product and validated market fit.
