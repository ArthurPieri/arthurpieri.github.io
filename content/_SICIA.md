# CAIXA ECONÔMICA FEDERAL ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM

## End-of-Project Summary Report

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

Our team successfully delivered a complete remote access control system for Caixa Econômica Federal, one of Brazil's largest banking institutions, with over 4,000 branches nationwide. The project addressed a critical security vulnerability where the previous vendor had disappeared, leaving the bank with unsupported access control infrastructure. We developed a new solution that maintained compatibility with existing hardware while providing enhanced security, centralized management, and future scalability.

### CHALLENGES ADDRESSED

- **Legacy Hardware Compatibility**: Reverse-engineered existing access controllers to develop compatible software without replacing hardware across 4,000+ branches
- **Security Requirements**: Implemented robust security protocols to protect bank branches while eliminating physical key risks
- **Geographic Scale**: Deployed and tested across Brazil's diverse regions, addressing regional variations and infrastructure differences
- **Knowledge Gap**: Overcame complete absence of documentation from the previous vendor
- **Rapid Deployment**: Established an aggressive timeline to secure all branches

### AGILE APPROACH

As Technical Leader, I implemented one of the first successful Scrum adoptions within Caixa's government structure:

- Dual-track agile teams focusing on hardware and software components simultaneously.
- Two-week sprints with dedicated demos to stakeholders
- Continuous integration practices ensuring compatibility across systems
- Adaptation of Scrum to accommodate government procurement and approval processes
- Daily collaboration between technical teams and branch operations personnel

### KEY MILESTONES & DELIVERABLES

- **Months 1-3**: Completed reverse engineering of existing hardware systems; established communication protocols
- **Month 5**: Finalized hardware solution using SD card replacements with our custom firmware
- **Month 7**: Deployed first working version to 70 pilot branches
- **Months 8-24**: Scaled solution to remaining branches, added new functionality, and addressed geographical adaptations
- **2019**: Completed nationwide deployment across all 4,000+ branches

### TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS

- Custom firmware for SD card deployment to existing controllers
- Web-based central management application
- Remote branch access monitoring and control
- Integration with the bank's existing security infrastructure
- Scalable architecture allows for future hardware additions

### BUSINESS VALUE DELIVERED

- Eliminated security risk of physical keys while maintaining branch access controls
- Saved millions in potential hardware replacement costs through software solution
- Centralized management of branch access across the entire Brazilian territory
- Enhanced security through proper access logging and monitoring
- Established a fully bank-owned solution, eliminating vendor dependency risks

### KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER & SUSTAINABILITY

- Comprehensive documentation of all systems and interfaces
- Training program for the bank's internal IT staff
- Supervised transition to the maintenance team
- Created a sustainability plan ensuring the long-term viability of the solution

### CONCLUSION

The project represents a significant technical achievement, overcoming complex reverse engineering challenges while delivering a secure, scalable solution that met all client requirements. Through effective agile practices and technical leadership, we transformed a critical security vulnerability into a robust, bank-owned system that continues to protect Caixa Econômica Federal branches nationwide.
